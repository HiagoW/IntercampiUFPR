This issue still exists, but I don't know if this is PMA or something else, anyway as workaround:

$ docker-compose exec mysql bash
$ mysql -u root -p 
You should be able to login as 'root' or your other password.

Execute the following commands:

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'root';
ALTER USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'root';
ALTER USER 'default'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'secret';
This should give you access in PMA.
